To-dos:
1) List the conditions for K fixed points and use the pris_dil_bounded and best_response_exists lemmas
inside the NE lemma

-- Done in line 152-155

2) Start working on the same things, but for mixed strategies
I'm going to move this to a second file to not mess things up here

- Create a simplex class

  -- didn't work out very well

- Switch from Action to Strategy (action is just strategy where ps are 1 or 0)

  -- See nash_mixed.lean for the start of this
  
- Do the same for a game that requires mixed strategy
 
  -- no particulat game was defined
  
- Probbaly won't finish this part, but think I can make some good progress on it

-- Other directions
    - Try to prove pieces of fixed point theorem
      -- Didn't have time
